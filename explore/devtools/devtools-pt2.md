1. The bug was that the two integers were string concatenation with the "Sum:" statement. For example, the sum of '10' and '86' was '1086.' 
2. The bug can be fixed by including the parseInt() method. We are converting the strings to integers so that the sum is calculated correctly using arithmetic.
